             <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>After I graduated from Park Center Senior High School, I went straight into working and became an Agent Consultation for Geek Squad at Best Buy.
                  I spent countless hours working with clients and ended up working as a Client Contact Specialist at the Best Buy Headquarters in Richfield, MN.
                   I have multiple friends and family who are Software Engineer's and they saw how much of a quick learner I was and
                   how much I'm able to push myself and thoroughly understand what they were doing that lead them to tell me jokingly "You should just become a coder."</p>
             
             
                   <p>After 4 years in the retail industry it was time for me to finally consider their words!
                        With technology all around us it was a no-brainer and I finally decided to learn how to code. 
                        Now a student at Thinkful, I hope to gain practical experience and skills to become a professional software developer.</p>
